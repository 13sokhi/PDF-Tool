This project is to make basic useful manipulations on PDF files, including merging, splitting, compressing, adding a watermark, converting to images, rotating, encrypting, decrypting and generating a PDF from Images

Use the requirements.txt to install all external modules required by the application to run my project on your computer

PDFToolManager.py is responsible for running this program - after cloning, just run this file
All other files have classes to get the actual functionality. I intent to create a GUI based application in future using these same classes

Why I created this project
I wanted to test my skills in Programming
However, the main reason was that sometimes I have to make changes to a PDF containing personal information that cannot be shared. Using online websites to do this is not
reliable, so I decided to solve this problem using programming and Python
That's why I created my own CLI based application to alter PDFs
